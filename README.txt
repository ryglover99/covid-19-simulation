The matricies file contains two matrix's that can be used in the simulation. 

The simulation currently has the office layout matrix implemented. 

To change the matrix to the clear one, that is also inside the matrix file, just copy and paste it over the matrix in the simulation file and run.

The Simulation contains:

- Social distancing logic
- Infection logic
- Obstacle avoidence
- Social distancing slider to change distance value
- Track of how many infected and healthy agents there are
- When the simulation exists, a graph of number of infected over time is displayed. The gradient at a single point on the graph is the infection rate
